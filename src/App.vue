/* EXPLANATION: An Event Bus is nothing but a global Vue instance that is imported
 by the components involved in communication and passing data */
// 1) In src, create a file, in this example "event-bus.js".
// Inside "event-bus.js", create the event bus, give it a name and export it.
// 2) Import the bus event in the components that will share data
// 3) Emit a custom-event containing the logic via the event bus. In this example, in component2
// 4) Listen to the custom event and its data. In this example, in component1.
// 5) In the listening component (component1), associate the custome event to a method or part
//    of the component where the data will be used.

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    Component1,
    Component2
  }
};
